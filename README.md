## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

      production: false,
      apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080/api'
    };
    ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Angular development server**:

    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Code scaffolding
